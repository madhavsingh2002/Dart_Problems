Problem: Implement a Simple Calculator
Create a simple calculator in Dart that can perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator should take two numbers and an operator as input and return the result.

Instructions:
Create a function calculate that takes three parameters: two numbers and a string representing the operator.
Based on the operator, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
Ensure that division by zero is handled gracefully.
Return the result of the operation
void main() {
  print(calculate(10, 5, '+')); // Output: 15
  print(calculate(10, 5, '-')); // Output: 5
  print(calculate(10, 5, '*')); // Output: 50
  print(calculate(10, 5, '/')); // Output: 2
  print(calculate(10, 0, '/')); // Output: Cannot divide by zero
}

dynamic calculate(num a, num b, String operator) {
  switch (operator) {
    case '+':
      return a + b;
    case '-':
      return a - b;
    case '*':
      return a * b;
    case '/':
      return b != 0 ? a / b : 'Cannot divide by zero';
    default:
      return 'Unsupported operator';
  }
}
